Drones
======

The end goal of drones is a robot combat game where the players don't
directly control their drones, but rather program them to interact
with their environment.  I hope to provide the virtual machine, an
assembler, a simple compiler, and of course an executable game that
will actually spawn the VMs and run them in a simulated environment.
More documentation will follow once I have more of the project
completed.
